In numerical analysis, the Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the unique polynomial of lowest degree that interpolates a given set of data


$${ \ell _{j}(x)={\frac {w_{j}}{x-x_{j}}}{\Bigg /}\sum _{m=0}^{k}{\frac {w_{m}}{x-x_{m}}}}$$

Although named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who published it in 1795,[1] the method was first discovered in 1779 by Edward Waring.[2] It is also an easy consequence of a formula published in 1783 by Leonhard Euler.[3]
